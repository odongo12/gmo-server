I'm currently an Atlassian consultant and to be honest, Confluence/Jira would be an almost perfect fit for our use case. However, since their investors demanded more revenue, they're not providing on premise versions anymore, only a clustered alternative which starts at $20k/yr. We can't even afford their non-profit offer for cloud, unfortunately. Features needed: - Customizable dashboard - Documentation/Wiki spaces - Generating multiple news feeds from multiple sources like newsletters and rss feeds - Collaborative editing (like in Google Docs / Confluence Synchrony) - Task and Ticket/Request management with multiple different workflows - Generating public Web content from private pages inside spaces, like Scroll Viewport I know, this is surely a lot to ask in terms of features, but if you happen to know multiple tools which could be integrated into each other to fit these requirements, I'm happy to hear the approach.",

    "content": "# Open collaboration **Open collaboration** refers to any \"system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who cooperate voluntarily to create a product (or service) of economic value, which is made freely available to contributors and noncontributors alike.\"[1] It is prominently observed in open source software, and has been initially described in Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto,[2] as well as Eric S. Raymond's 1997 essay, The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Beyond open source software, open collaboration is also applied to the development of other types of mind or creative works, such as information provision in Internet forums, or the production of encyclopedic content in Wikipedia.[3] The organizing principle behind open collaboration is that of peer production.[4] Peer production communities are structured in an entirely decentralized manner, but differ from markets in that they function without price-based coordination, and often on the basis of volunteering only. Such communities are geared toward the production of openly accessible public or \"common\" goods, but differ from the State as well as charity groups in that they operate without a formal hierarchical structure, and rest solely on the construction of a rough, evolving consensus among participants.[5][6] ## Definition [edit]Riehle et al. define open collaboration as collaboration based on three principles of egalitarianism, meritocracy, and self-organization.[7] Levine and Piretula define open collaboration as \"any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value, which they make available to contributors and noncontributors alike.\"[8][9] This definition captures multiple instances, all joined by similar principles. For example, all of the elements — goods of economic value, open access to contribute and consume, interaction and exchange, purposeful yet loosely coordinated work — are present in an open source software project, in Wikipedia, or in a user forum or community. They can also be present in a commercial website that is based on user-generated content. In all of these instances of open collaboration, anyone can contribute and anyone can freely partake in the fruits of sharing, which are produced by interacting participants who are loosely coordinated.[10]: 17 ## Academia [edit]An annual conference dedicated to the research and practice of open collaboration is the International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym, formerly WikiSym).[11] As per its website, the group defines open collaboration as \"collaboration that is egalitarian (everyone can join, no principled or artificial barriers to participation exist), meritocratic (decisions and status are merit-based rather than imposed) and self-organizing (processes adapt to people rather than people adapt to pre-defined processes).\"[12] Since 2011, a peer-reviewed academic journal, *The Journal of Peer Production* (JoPP), is dedicated to documenting and researching peer production processes. This academic community understands peer production \"as a mode of commons-based and oriented production in which participation is voluntary and predicated on the self-selection of tasks. Notable examples are the collaborative development of Free Software projects and of the Wikipedia online encyclopedia.\"[13] ## See also [edit]- Peer production or Commons-based peer production - Money-free market - Open-source model - Resource-based economy - Open knowledge ## References [edit]**^**Sheen S.

    "content": "Today's workplace is all about collaboration, and as more teams go remote, the need for innovative tools is stronger than ever. Here are eight open source projects that could help take your virtual collaborations from good to great. Open source projects are all about creativity and collaboration, and the process really shines when the project itself supports teamwork. Working together to create software for working together might seem very meta, but the results are quite tangible. Here are eight open source projects that can help boost your team’s collaboration, whether you are working in a distributed team, from your home office, or onsite in one of the newer hybrid workplaces. Jitsi The COVID-19 pandemic may or may not be over, but remote work and video calls are now a permanent part of our world. Jitsi is an open source project that supplies both the browser-side code and the server-side bridge, so you can host your own calls without relying on Zoom or Google Meet. You can run everything on your own hardware or support the project by signing up for the Jitsi service. Zulip Most teams also need a way to discuss their work in real-time and asynchronously, in which case Zulip could be the messaging platform you’ve been looking for. As an open source alternative to Slack, Zulip lets you control the code. It also has custom apps for all the major smartphone and desktop platforms. Mattermost Mattermost is another self-hosted messaging tool that supports team messaging, but in this case, it’s designed especially for software development. The project boasts a vibrant community, which has built out a good server for securely managing the message flow. What really sets Mattermost apart is its collection of software development playbooks with special features like checklists and coding retrospectives. Mattermost is also available as a web application and a mobile tool. Cyn.in Projects that need a shared space can turn to Cyn.in, which seeks to duplicate the shared access that you might experience in an IRL project lab or “war room.” The community edition offers data sharing features like a wiki and collaborative file repositories. It also offers enhanced tracking tools that can keep coworkers from stepping on each other’s toes by locking content and tracking access. Extra features like voting and search round out a complete system that can make a virtual office space even better than a physical one. Kolab Managing teams is what Kolab is all about. It organizes milestones, tracks projects, and keeps an eye on individual team members as everyone works toward the goal. Kolab also includes features for team blogging, project documentation, and group discussions. NextCloud The team at NextCloud gathered up some of the best open source projects for supporting group collaboration with email, chat, and calendaring. Then, they packaged them all into a stable distribution that anyone can install at home or in an office. Now, you can have your choice of the best applications for running an office or a household, while also controlling the back end. Group Office Creating documents, slide shows, or spreadsheets is the lifeblood of many office tasks. Group Office is a groupware platform that supports these basic tasks as well as many of the other important chores of office management. Features include timesheets, billing, and customer relations management. The basics are supported in the community edition, but the company also offers more professional services and custom development. GitLab Developers are familiar with using a version control system like Git to keep track of code and record version changes. GitLab is a GitHub alternative that makes it easier to collaborate and manage your code from a browser. It’s especially well suited to devops and includes features for managing security and compliance in a devops pipeline. The hosted version is available for a fee and there’s a community edition for running it locally.",

    "content": "# Open Source Software: Community Collaboration and Innovation Open source software (OSS) has become a cornerstone of modern technology, driving innovation and collaboration across the globe. Unlike proprietary software, open source relies on a community-driven model where the source code is freely available, encouraging developers to contribute, modify, and distribute the software. This collaborative approach has not only transformed the way software is developed but has also fostered a culture of innovation that transcends traditional boundaries. # Evolution of Open Source Software: The roots of open source software can be traced back to the Free Software Movement initiated by Richard Stallman in the 1980s. Stallman advocated for the freedom to view, modify, and share software, leading to the development of the GNU project and the General Public License (GPL). The rise of the internet in the 1990s further accelerated the open source movement, providing a global platform for collaborative development. # Community-Driven Development: At the heart of open source lies a diverse and dynamic community of developers, designers, and enthusiasts who collaborate to create and enhance software. This collaborative model extends beyond geographical and organizational boundaries, creating a melting pot of ideas and expertise. Developers from different backgrounds and industries come together to contribute code, report issues, and improve documentation, collectively shaping the software’s evolution. # Key Principles of Open Source Development: **Transparency:**Open source projects operate with a high degree of transparency. The entire source code is accessible to anyone interested, allowing users to understand how the software works and providing developers with insights into potential improvements.**Collaboration:**Collaboration is a fundamental principle of open source development. Contributors collaborate through online platforms, version control systems, and communication channels, fostering a sense of shared ownership and collective responsibility.**Community Engagement:**Open source thrives on community engagement. Users not only have the freedom to use the software but are also encouraged to participate in discussions, report issues, and contribute code. This engagement enhances the software’s quality and adaptability.**Meritocracy:**Open source projects often operate on a meritocratic basis, where contributions are evaluated based on their merit rather than the contributor’s background or affiliation. This promotes a culture of inclusivity and values the skills and expertise each individual brings to the community. # Advantages of Open Source Software: **Innovation:**The open nature of the source code allows for continuous innovation. Developers can experiment, customize, and extend the software to meet diverse needs, driving rapid advancements in functionality and features.**Cost-Effectiveness:**Open source software is cost-effective, as it eliminates licensing fees and allows organizations to allocate resources towards customization and support rather than proprietary software costs.**Security:**Security is often enhanced in open source projects due to the transparent nature of the code. With a large community scrutinizing the codebase, vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed promptly.**Flexibility:**Open source software provides flexibility and freedom to adapt the software according to specific requirements. This flexibility is particularly valuable for organizations with unique needs that may not be met by off-the-shelf solutions. # Challenges in Open Source Development: **Sustainability**: Some open source projects face challenges in sustaining momentum. Maintaining a vibrant community and ensuring ongoing contributions are crucial for the longevity of a project.**Documentation and Usability:**While open source projects offer extensive documentation, some projects may struggle with user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive guides. Improving these aspects can enhance the accessibility of open source software. # Case Studies: Successful Open Source Projects: **Linux Kernel:**The Linux kernel is a prime example of successful open source collaboration. Developed by a global community, it powers a significant portion of the world’s servers and serves as the foundation for various operating systems.**Apache HTTP Server:**The Apache HTTP Server, often referred to as Apache, is a widely used open source web server. Its modular architecture and community-driven development have made it a reliable and scalable choice for hosting websites. # Future Trends and Conclusion: As technology continues to evolve, open source software remains a driving force behind innovation. The rise of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and edge computing has seen an influx of open source projects, showcasing the adaptability and resilience of the collaborative model. In conclusion, open source software stands as a testament to ...",

    "content": "This article was originally published in *Contingencies*, March/April 2019 and first appeared on LinkedIn, January 2, 2019. The Github Octocat logo: Have you heard of Git? Github, maybe? Git was created by Linus Torvald in 2005 to support the development of Linux[i], which in 2016 ran an estimated 67 percent of web servers. Android runs on Linux. Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia all run on Linux.[ii] It is hard to understate the impact of Git, Github and the open-source revolution. To give another sense of the scope of this space, Github was recently purchased by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.[iii] There are 96 million projects—repositories, in Git lingo—and 31 million developers on Github[iv], myself included.[v] My purpose with this article is to share my experience with Git and open source, and encourage you to consider using it at your company to enhance collaboration. A year ago, I had only heard of Git. I hadn’t used it. Today I rely on it heavily at work for multiple projects daily. I use it to manage my homework between my Linux-enabled Chromebook and home PC. I can feel the cortisol flowing—that’s the stress hormone—any time I think of not having it as a tool. I credit two influences for my reliance on Git and passion for sharing the message: Rajesh Sahasrabuddhe and an open-source hackathon by Uptake[vi] in Chicago. Raj is a thought leader in our company and was one of the few people there using Git when I joined in 2017. He introduced me to Bitbucket. Raj is a Bitbucket evangelist because he understands the power of using it. It wasn’t easy at first. Using Git is very different from the typical way of managing project files on network drives. It took me a few months to build the intuition and start trusting the technology. Today, it is second nature and requires much less thinking than my prior approach. After using Git at the office, I felt like I could take on my first hackathon. I got word through the University of Chicago that an event was taking place. Uptake sent an open invite: Come to their office for free snacks (and beer) and make some contributions to open source. After a brief introduction to working with open source, we started looking for ways to contribute. It wasn’t hard: Go to the Github page of your favorite project and look through the issues page for something you’d like to work on. This feature alone is a game-changer. I found an open issue on an R package I use daily, lubridate. The task was to remove dependence on another package, stringr, so that lubridate could load faster and not have the risk of requiring separate code. My first submission was a partial solution, which as it turns out isn’t really that helpful, but it was all I had time to finish. I was really nervous—who am I to contribute to this important project? Figure 1 The project admins were kind and patient and educated me on how to be a better contributor. I worked with them through a few iterations and finally settled on a complete solution a few weeks later. I was so excited when my pull request was merged and my code became part of the software that is the go-to for working with dates for more than 2 million R users! I highly recommend attempting a contribution. You can see this whole process including our back-and-forth and the pull request on Github.[vii] I’d recommend taking a few minutes to skim it; it will give you a sense for how this works in the wild, and how it might work at your company. **Wait, What Just Happened ? ** Now, a moment for reflection. This is wild, right? I’m some random person, and I just logged on to Github, forked a copy of the code, made some changes, and requested the admins pull my code into a project that potentially 2 million people rely on for their code to work in businesses, at universities, and on personal computers. **How does this not break?** This is the power of open source. It is built around this need for things to work when they are built by people who don’t necessarily know each other or the history of the project. I didn’t review all the code in the project. I just found the specific spots that needed work. This is why open source is taking over. It removes every barrier to collaboration. My code will work because I made changes to a separate copy of the code; before my changes were even reviewed by a person, over a thousand automated tests were run to ensure I didn’t break or change anything I wasn’t supposed to. It took me a few tries to get past that part. Then it was reviewed by an expert who made suggestions using the Github platform. We went back and forth, and once it looked good and passed all the tests, it was easy to bring the changes in without any ambiguity or mistakes, thanks to Git. **Collaborating the Open-Source Wa y** Keep the above story in mind as I discuss how collaboration works with open source. - Code is stored online (remote) in a repository (repo) with one or more users set up as owners. This is typically on Github or Bitbucket. These can be ...",

    "content": "# A Guide to Open Source Collaboration for Beginners Open source collaboration is the process of working together with other developers to create and maintain open source software. Open source software is software that has its source code freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This makes it possible for anyone to contribute to the development of open source software, regardless of their skill level or location. Open source collaboration is important because it allows developers to pool their skills and resources to create software that is better than any one individual could create on their own. It also allows developers to learn from each other and to share their knowledge with the community. There are many benefits to contributing to open source projects. Some of the benefits include: If you are new to open source collaboration, don't worry! There are many resources available to help you get started. In this blog post, we will provide a beginner's guide to open source collaboration. We will cover everything from finding a project to contribute to making your first contribution and collaborating with other contributors. ## Finding a project to contribute to Once you have decided that you want to contribute to an open source project, the next step is to find a project that you are interested in and that you have the skills to contribute to. There are a number of ways to find open source projects to contribute to. One way is to browse open source directories such as GitHub Explore, GitLab Explore, and Open Source Friday. These websites list thousands of open source projects, so you are sure to find something that interests you. Another way to find open source projects to contribute to is to look for projects that you use on a regular basis. For example, if you use the Linux operating system, you could look for Linux-related projects to contribute to. Or, if you use a particular programming language, you could look for projects that use that language. Once you have found a few projects that you are interested in, you should take some time to learn more about each project. Read the project's documentation, browse the code, and see what kind of issues the project is facing. This will help you to determine which project is the best fit for you. When choosing a project to contribute to, it is important to consider the following factors: ### Looking for beginner-friendly issues Once you have chosen a project to contribute to, you should look for beginner-friendly issues to work on. Beginner-friendly issues are typically small and well-defined. This makes them a good choice for beginners because they are more likely to be able to complete them successfully. To find beginner-friendly issues, you can look for issues that are labeled with the \"good first issue\" tag. You can also search for issues that are marked as \"easy\" or \"low priority.\" If you are having trouble finding beginner-friendly issues, you can ask for help from the project's maintainers.
