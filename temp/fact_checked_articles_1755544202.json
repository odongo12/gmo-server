    "content": "Engineers design plants using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to improve taste, nutritional content, and resilience. However, people have concerns over their safety, and there is much debate about the pros and cons of using GMOs. Scientists create GMO foods by introducing genetic material, or DNA, from a different organism through genetic engineering. Most of the currently available GMO foods are plants, such as fruit and vegetables. In the United States, the GMO foods are likely to become a crucial tool in feeding the world’s growing population, especially in areas with harsh climates. However, there have been concerns about possible risks. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of GMO crops, including their potential effects on human health and the environment. Manufacturers use genetic modification to give foods desirable traits. Potential advantages of GMO crops include attractiveness to consumers, resilience, nutritional value, and less waste. ### Attractiveness GMO crops may be increasingly attractive to consumers. Examples of this include apples and potatoes that are Some believe that GMO foods may have an enhanced flavor compared to non-GMO foods. However, there is no evidence to show that genetic modification has any effect on the taste, smell, or appearance of foods in the U.S. In fact, most people cannot tell the difference between GMO and non-GMO foods. ### Resilience and less waste Most GMO crops in the U.S. were developed to help farmers. They are more resilient crops that help prevent crop and food loss. Some of the reasons farmers choose to grow GMO crops - higher tolerance to herbicides, making it easier to control weeds - greater resistance to certain plant viruses, which can help increase food security by reducing food waste - greater residence to damaging insects, which can help reduce the use of pesticides GMO crops may also be ### Nutritional value Certain types of GMOs may add nutritional value to foods. An example of this is golden rice. This is a product that is engineered to provide higher levels of vitamin A to consumers. While it can provide nutritional value to those who eat it, especially in areas where vitamin A deficiency is an issue, the growth of this product is not widespread. It is not currently a part of the U.S. food system. Growing plants that are more resistant to diseases spread by insects or viruses will likely result in higher yields for farmers and a more attractive product. All these factors can contribute to lower costs for the consumer and can ensure that more people have access to quality food. Genetically engineering foods is a relatively new practice, which means the long-term effects on safety are not yet clear. Many concerns about the disadvantages relate to human health. Scientists have not yet shown that GMO foods are harmful to health, but research is ongoing. ### Allergic reactions There is a small risk that GMO foods can trigger an allergic reaction, but this will only happen if the genetic change triggers the production of an allergen. For instance, if scientists combine a gene from a Brazil nut with a soybean, there is a The Scientists assess the likelihood of GMO foods causing an allergic reaction in humans before a product reaches the market and can prevent its launch if necessary. ### Cancer There have been concerns that eating GMO foods can contribute to the development of cancer by raising levels of potentially carcinogenic substances in the body. The While cancer rates ### Antibacterial resistance Some GMOs contain changes that make them resistant to certain antibiotics. In theory, the genes from these plants could enter humans or animals when they eat them. As a result, the person or animal could also develop antibiotic resistance. The likelihood of this happening is very small, but the ### Changes in human DNA In older Some people have also raised fears that eating GMO food could lead to genetic changes in humans. However, most of the DNA in food — whether GMO or not — either is destroyed by cooking or breaks down before it reaches the large intestine. Small fragments of DNA from food can and do enter the bloodstream and body organs, but there is no evidence that they have any impact on genetic makeup or human health. ### Toxicity for body organs In older The use of GMO crops Climate change and severe weather events are disrupting food production and supply. GMO foods could help maintain supplies in the face of changing environmental conditions and a growing population. ### Pros Genetically modifying some foods could make them: - easier to store and transport - less prone to waste due to disease and aging - more likely to grow in areas with poor-quality soil - higher in nutrients Also, a ### Cons Environmental concerns - the risk of outcrossing, where genes from GMO foods pass into wild plants and other crops - a negative impact on insects and other species - reduction in other plant types, leading to a loss of biodive...",

These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems. The review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each GM food, but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings. The results of most studies with GM foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters. However, many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment. The use of recombinant GH or its expression in animals should be re-examined since it has been shown that it increases IGF-1 which may promote cancer. ## Comment in - Response to \"Health risks of genetically modified foods\".Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2010 Jan;50(1):85-91; author reply 92-5. doi: 10.1080/10408390903467787.

    "title": "GMO Pros and Cons, Backed by Evidence",
    "content": "Although most notable organizations and research suggest that GMO foods are safe and sustainable, some people claim they may harm your health and the environment. GMOs, short for genetically modified organisms, are subject to much controversy. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), GMO seeds are used to plant over 90% of all maize (corn), cotton, and soy grown in the United States, which means that many of the foods you eat likely contain GMOs. This article explains GMOs, balances their pros and cons, and provides guidance on how to identify GMO foods. “GMO,” which stands for genetically modified organism, refers to any organism whose DNA has been modified using genetic engineering technology. In the food industry, GMO crops have had genes added to them for - their growth - nutritional content - sustainability - pest resistance - ease of farming While it’s possible to naturally give foods desirable traits through selective breeding, this process takes many generations. Also, breeders may be unable to determine which genetic change led to a new trait. Genetic modification accelerates this process by using scientific techniques that give the plant the desired trait. GMO crops are common in the United States, with at least GMO foods may offer advantages to the grower and consumer. These can include: **Pest control:**Many GMO crops have been genetically modified to express a gene that protects them against pests and insects. The*Bt*gene is commonly genetically engineered into crops like corn, cotton, and soybeans. It comes from a naturally occurring bacteria known as Bacillus thuringiensis. This gene produces a toxic protein to several pests and insects, which gives the GMO plants a natural resistance. As such, GMO cropsdon’t need to be exposed to harmful pesticides as often.**Fewer pesticides:**A 2020 study notes that GMO technology has reduced global chemical pesticide use by8.3% and indirectly reduced greenhouse gas emissions because farmers don’t need to spray their fields as often.**Improved survival and greater yield:**Other GMO crops have been modified with genes that help them survive stressful conditions, such asdroughts , and resist diseases likeblight , resulting in a higher yield for farmers.**Increased nutritional value:**Genetic modification can increase the nutritional value of foods. For example, rice high in beta carotene, also called golden rice,was developed to help prevent blindness in regions where local diets are chronically deficient in vitamin A.**Enhanced flavor:**Genetic modificationcan enhance the flavor and appearance of foods, such as the non-browning apple. However, the While GMO crops make farming much easier, there is some concern about their potential effect on the environment and their safety for human consumption, particularly surrounding illnesses and allergies. Some of the potential concerns around GMO consumption include: **Allergies:**Because GMO foods contain foreign genes, some people worry that they harbor genes from foods that may prompt an allergic reaction. According to theFDA , researchers who develop GMO foods run tests to ensure that allergens aren’t transferred from one food to another. Research suggests GMO foods are no likelier to trigger allergies than their non-GMO counterparts.**Cancer:**Because DNA mutations cause cancers, some people fear that eating foods with added genes may affect your DNA. TheAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) has stated that there’s no evidence to link GMO food intake to an increased or decreased risk of cancer, and there is no evidence that eating GMOs will change your DNA. However, more long-term human research is still needed.**Herbicide use:**Most GMO crops are resistant to herbicides, such as Roundup, so farmers may use herbicides to kill surrounding weeds without damage to their crops. But Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate are subject to controversy because animal and test-tube studies have linked them to various diseases. There is new evidence that glyphosate exposure may increase the relative risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma by41% .**Honeybees:**There has also been concern that pollen from Bt cropsmay negatively impact honeybees, but there doesn’t seem to be any solid evidence to support this yet. Although GMO foods appear safe for consumption, some people wish to avoid them. Still, this is difficult since most foods in your supermarket are made with ingredients from GMO crops. In the United States, no regulations currently mandate the labeling of GMO foods. Yet, as of January 2022, the USDA requires food manufacturers to label all foods containing GMO ingredients. That said, the labels won’t say “GMO” but instead the term “bioengineered food.” It will display either as the USDA bioengineered food symbol, listed on or near the ingredients or as a scannable code on the package with directions, such as “Scan here for more information.” Some foods may have a third-party “Non-GMO project verified” label, which ...",

    "content": "Industrial agriculture is a system with an expiration date. It’s only a few decades old, but just start adding up the environmental costs we are incurring by this broken system — more and more polluted waterways, clear-cut forests, inhumane treatment of livestock, and megatons of greenhouse gases. It’s quite simply unsustainable. So many of the foods we eat everyday are sprayed again and again with pesticides before landing on our table. There are a growing number of studies that have associated certain pesticides with increased cancer risk and with diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, especially among those with high exposures. Unborn children are especially vulnerable because pesticides have also been associated with birth defects. What most people don’t know is the connection between GMOs and pesticides: the surge in genetically engineered crops in the past few decades is one the main drivers of increased pesticide use and chemicals in agriculture. As a matter of fact, genetically engineered crops directly promote an industrial and chemical-intensive model of farming harmful to people, the environment, and wildlife. Because of corporate pressure, millions like us are denied the right to know about where GMOs occur in the food chain. Mandatory GMO labeling is the rule in only a handful of countries. Giant agricultural firms insist that GMO crops are not harmful to humans, but the world simply doesn’t have enough evidence to make that absolute claim. GMO crops have only gone mainstream in the past 20 years. Beyond that, giant agricultural firms should not have the right to own the genetic makeup of a particular strain of corn or soy or, in essence, patent nature. We shouldn’t accept a world where chemical giants go after small farmers because a patented seed accidentally blew into their field and transformed their crops. GMOs threaten the independence of farmers to provide food to us all be ensuring their sovereignty over what to grow. ## What You Should Know - Mandatory GMO labelling is the rule in 64 countries, but major markets like the United States, Canada, Argentina, and most of continental Africa do not require it. - Monsanto is the world’s top producer of GMO seeds, which are designed to resist the toxic weedkiller RoundUp, also sold by Monsanto. As a result, the use of toxic herbicides like Roundup has increased 15 times since GMOs were introduced. Glyphosate, the active ingredient of RoundUp, was reclassified as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization. - Pesticide use has increased by 404 million pounds from the time genetically engineered crops were introduced back in 1996. ## What You Can Do Help jumpstart an eco-food revolution by sharing this page, then click to see **What You Can Do** today.",

    "content": "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are plants, animals, or microbes that have had their DNA changed using genetic engineering techniques. Another term for this is bioengineered foods. ## Function Genetic engineering can be done with plants, animals, or bacteria and other very small organisms. With genetic engineering, scientists take the gene for a desired trait in one plant or animal, and they insert that gene into the DNA of another plant or animal. Genes can also be moved from an animal to a plant or vice versa. The process to create GMOs is different than selective breeding. This involves selecting plants or animals with desired traits and breeding them. Over time, this results in offspring with those desired traits. One of the problems with selective breeding is that it can also result in traits that are not desired. Genetic engineering allows scientists to select one specific gene to implant. This avoids introducing other genes with undesirable traits. Genetic engineering also helps speed up the process of creating new foods with desired traits. Genome editing is a newer method that involves adding, removing, or changing the DNA of a plant or animal in a targeted way. The possible benefits of genetic engineering include: - More nutritious food - Tastier food - Disease- and drought-resistant plants that require fewer environmental resources (such as water and fertilizer) - Insect-resistant plants that allows less use of pesticides - Increased supply of food with reduced cost and longer shelf life - Faster growing plants and animals - Food with more desirable traits, such as potatoes that produce less of a cancer-causing substance when fried Some people have expressed concerns about GE foods, such as: - Creation of foods that can cause an allergic or toxic reaction - Unexpected or harmful genetic changes - Inadvertent transfer of genes from one GM plant or animal to another plant or animal not intended for genetic modification - Foods that are less nutritious - Decrease in biodiversity These concerns have thus far been unfounded. None of the GMOs used today have caused any of these problems. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses all GMOs to make sure they are safe before allowing them to be sold. In addition to the FDA, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulate bioengineered plants and animals. They assess the safety of GMOs to humans, animals, plants, and the environment. ## Food Sources Cotton, corn, and soybeans are the main GMO crops grown in the United States. Most of these are used to make ingredients for other foods, such as: - Corn syrup used as a sweetener in many foods and drinks - Corn starch used in soups and sauces - Soybean, corn, and canola oils used in snack foods, breads, salad dressings, and mayonnaise - Sugar from sugar beets - Livestock feed Other GMO crops include one or more varieties of the following: - Apples - Alfalfa - Canola - Eggplant (not available in the United States) - Papayas - Pineapples - Potatoes - Salmon - Squash - Sugar beets - Sugarcane - Zucchini ## Side Effects There are no side effects from consuming GMO foods. ## Recommendations The World Health Organization, the National Academy of Science, and several other major science organizations across the globe have reviewed research on GMOs and have found no evidence that they are harmful. There are no reports of illness, injury, or environmental harm due to GMOs. Genetically engineered foods are just as safe as conventional foods. The US Department of Agriculture has recently started requiring food manufacturers to disclose information about bioengineered foods and their ingredients. ## Alternative Names Bioengineered foods; GMOs; Genetically engineered foods, genome editing; Living modified organisms; LMOs ## References US Department of Agriculture website.

    "content": "A significant percentage of processed foods purchased today contain some genetically engineered (GE) food products. As a result, each day, tens of millions of American infants, children and adults eat genetically engineered foods without their knowledge. Consumers have no way of knowing what foods are genetically engineered because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require labeling of these products. What’s worse, the agency also does not require any pre-market safety testing of GE foods. The agency’s failure to require testing or labeling of GE foods has made millions of consumers into guinea pigs, unknowingly testing the safety of dozens of gene-altered food products. The FDA, in its response to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Food Safety in 1998, admitted in court that it had made “no dispositive scientific findings,” whatsoever, about the safety of genetically engineered foods. In other words, the FDA has given the biotech industry carte blanche to produce and market any number of genetically engineered foods without mandatory agency oversight or safety testing and without a scientific showing that these foods are safe to consume. **Six Potential Human Health Concerns** Genetically engineered foods are different from other foods. Genetic engineering allows, for the first time, foreign genes, bacterial and viral vectors, viral promoters and antibiotic marker systems to be engineered into food. These genetic “cassettes” are new to the human diet and should be subject to extensive safety testing. Instead, in 1992 the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) ruled, without any scientific basis, that genetically engineered foods present no different risks than traditional foods. FDA’s own scientists ridiculed this unscientific agency view of genetic engineering. “What happened to the scientific elements in [the] document?,” one asked. FDA scientists consistently stated that “[t]here is a profound difference between the types of unexpected effects from traditional breeding and genetic engineering. ... [T]his difference should be and is not addressed.” **What are the new “unexpected effects” and health risks posed by genetic engineering?** Genetically engineered foods are inherently unstable. Each insertion of a novel gene, and the accompanying “cassette” of promoters, antibiotic marker systems and vectors, is random. GE food producers simply do not know where their genetic “cassette” is being inserted in the food, nor do they know enough about the genetic/chemical makeup of foods to establish a “safe” place for such insertions. As a result, each gene insertion into a food amounts to playing food safety “roulette,” with the companies hoping that the new genetic material does not destabilize a safe food and make it hazardous. Each genetic insertion creates the added possibility that formerly nontoxic elements in the food could become toxic. FDA was well aware of the “genetic instability” problem prior to establishing their no-testing policy. FDA scientists warned that this problem could create dangerous toxins in food and was a significant health risk. The scientists specifically warned that the genetic engineering of foods could result in “increased levels of known naturally occurring toxicants, appearance of new, not previously identified toxicants, [and] increased capability of concentrating toxic substances from the environment (e.g., pesticides or heavy metals).” These same FDA scientists recommended that long term toxicological tests be required prior to the marketing of GE foods. FDA officials also were aware that safety testing on the first genetically engineered food, the Calgene Flavr Savr tomato, had shown that consumption of this product resulted in stomach lesions in laboratory rats. FDA’s response to the potential toxicity problem with genetically engineered foods was to ignore it. They disregarded their own scientists, the clear scientific evidence and the deaths and illnesses already attributed to this problem. The agency refused to require pre-market toxicological testing for GE foods or any toxicity monitoring. FDA made these decisions with no scientific basis and without public notice and comment or independent scientific review. The agency’s actions can only be seen as a shameful acquiescence to industry pressure and a complete abandonment of its responsibility to assure food safety. ** **The genetic engineering of food creates two separate and serious health risks involving allergenicity. The first is that genetic engineering can transfer allergens from foods to which people know they are allergic, to foods that they think are safe. This risk is not hypothetical. A study by the There is another allergy risk associated with GE foods. These foods could be creating thousands of different and new allergic responses. Each genetic “cassette” being engineered into foods contains a number of novel proteins (in the form of altered genes, bacteria, viruses, promoters, marker systems...",

    "title": "What's wrong with GMOs? A lot. - The Non-GMO Project",
    "content": "When GMOs were commercialized in the 1990s, few people knew about these novel organisms entering the food supply. Their development, testing and deployment had occurred with a startling lack of transparency. However, as early GMOs and their derivatives made their way into more and more common food products, folks in the natural foods sector started asking questions. Some of those folks went on to found the Non-GMO Project, North America’s most rigorous third-party verification for non-GMO food and products. From time to time, people ask us why we do the work we do. What do we have against GMOs, anyways? The answer to that question is not short. From the unsettling origins of the GMO experiment, we've witnessed a complex web of negative impacts and downstream effects that start with this technology. The GMO food web and the technology driving it have evolved, and so do the consequences. What's wrong with GMOs? We'll walk you through it. ### Corporate consolidation and short-term studies The first GMOs were developed by chemical companies with ingenious business plans. For example, Monsanto sold chemicals for decades before engineering herbicide-tolerant \"Roundup Ready\" soybeans in 1996. By creating herbicide-tolerant GMOs, they gained restrictive utility patents on a major commodity crop *and* sold a lot more of their signature weedkiller, Roundup, a companion product to the GMO soy. The plan worked so well that glyphosate-based herbicides such as Roundup have seen a 15-fold increase in use since Monsanto introduced its first GMO. Very little was known about GMOs when they entered the food supply. Most people were unaware that everyday food products contained ingredients derived from novel organisms. Even fewer people knew that safety testing was mainly short-term feeding studies conducted by the same corporations who created GMOs and stood to profit from their adoption. Without independent safety assessments, the long-term impacts of GMOs are unknown. Meanwhile, those utility patents helped solidify agricultural companies' growing seed supply monopoly. Today, most of the world's seeds are owned by just four corporations. ### Environmental antagonists The dramatic spike in herbicide use is a sobering outcome of GMO adoption, but it's not the only one. There are significant downstream impacts from adopting this technology and the chemical inputs that go with it. That business plan to sell more weedkillers alongside patented GMO seeds worked like a charm. Farmers sprayed more glyphosate more often, and subsequently, \"superweeds\" with evolved resistance to those chemicals rose up in response. Herbicide tolerance wasn't the only GMO trait. Genetically engineered corn was created to produce its own insecticidal bacteria. Because the insecticide was constantly present as the corn grew, insect populations developed similar tolerance as the superweeds. It's a case of be-careful-what-you-wish-for: If GMO manufacturers pictured pristine landscapes that produced only the GMO crops they designed, they were engineering a certain kind of doom. Landscapes aren't meant to be pristine or monotonous, and nature rebels against a lack of diversity. In the end, GMOs are antithetical to the kind of regenerative food system we desperately need to feed a growing population on a warming planet. Improving soil health, protecting biodiversity and curbing greenhouse gasses are critical initiatives to support human wellbeing. GMOs move us in the opposite direction, towards monocrops, homogeneity and chemical dependence. ### The cultural impacts of GMOs Some of the most damning impacts of an industrialized and engineered food system are cultural and social. Food is a basic human need. It's also a crucial element of the social fabric of communities worldwide. We gather for feasts and celebrations, expressing cultural identities through the food we share. Traditionally people ate globally diverse diets to reflect our cultural backgrounds. However, the types of foods we consume have consolidated over time to become more homogenous worldwide. As part of our Speaker Series, we spoke with author Diane Wilson about her book \"The Seed Keeper.\" The novel explores Indigenous food sovereignty through the stories of four Native American women and the loss of traditional foods and cultural practices after colonization. \"You move people onto reservations, you give them commodity foods that come in a sack, so it's high starch high fat, and immediately you see a shift in both the spiritual and the physical health of people and the emotional wellbeing because it's very compromising to your sense of self as an Indigenous person to be living in this way.\" Wilson is enrolled on the Rosebud Reservation, and she works as part of the growing movement to restore Indigenous food sovereignty. \"We're reclaiming that old relationship… and we're rebuilding the health of our communities by returning to those traditional foods.\" Respecting and restoring food's cultura...",

    "title": "Genetically modified foods: safety, risks and public concerns—a review",
    "content": "## Abstract Genetic modification is a special set of gene technology that alters the genetic machinery of such living organisms as animals, plants or microorganisms. Combining genes from different organisms is known as recombinant DNA technology and the resulting organism is said to be ‘Genetically modified (GM)’, ‘Genetically engineered’ or ‘Transgenic’. The principal transgenic crops grown commercially in field are herbicide and insecticide resistant soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. Other crops grown commercially and/or field-tested are sweet potato resistant to a virus that could destroy most of the African harvest, rice with increased iron and vitamins that may alleviate chronic malnutrition in Asian countries and a variety of plants that are able to survive weather extremes. There are bananas that produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, fish that mature more quickly, fruit and nut trees that yield years earlier and plants that produce new plastics with unique properties. Technologies for genetically modifying foods offer dramatic promise for meeting some areas of greatest challenge for the 21st century. Like all new technologies, they also pose some risks, both known and unknown. Controversies and public concern surrounding GM foods and crops commonly focus on human and environmental safety, labelling and consumer choice, intellectual property rights, ethics, food security, poverty reduction and environmental conservation. With this new technology on gene manipulation what are the risks of “tampering with Mother Nature”?, what effects will this have on the environment?, what are the health concerns that consumers should be aware of? and is recombinant technology really beneficial? This review will also address some major concerns about the safety, environmental and ecological risks and health hazards involved with GM foods and recombinant technology. **Keywords:** Genetically modified foods, Genetically engineered foods, Transgenic foods, Food safety, Allergenic foods, Public concerns ## Introduction Scientists first discovered in 1946 that DNA can be transferred between organisms (Clive 2011). It is now known that there are several mechanisms for DNA transfer and that these occur in nature on a large scale, for example, it is a major mechanism for antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. The first genetically modified (GM) plant was produced in 1983, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. China was the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in the early 1990s with the introduction of virus resistant tobacco. In 1994, the transgenic ‘Flavour Saver tomato’ was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the USA. The modification allowed the tomato to delay ripening after picking. In 1995, few transgenic crops received marketing approval. This include canola with modified oil composition (Calgene), *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) corn/maize (Ciba-Geigy), cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil (Calgene), Bt cotton (Monsanto), Bt potatoes (Monsanto), soybeans resistant to the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto), virus-resistant squash (Asgrow) and additional delayed ripening tomatoes (DNAP, Zeneca/Peto, and Monsanto) (Clive 2011). A total of 35 approvals had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop of carnations with 8 different traits in 6 countries plus the EU till 1996 (Clive 1996). As of 2011, the USA leads a list of multiple countries in the production of GM crops. Currently, there are a number of food species in which a genetically modified version exists (Johnson 2008). Some of the foods that are available in the market include cotton, soybean, canola, potatoes, eggplant, strawberries, corn, tomatoes, lettuce, cantaloupe, carrots etc. GM products which are currently in the pipeline include medicines and vaccines, foods and food ingredients, feeds and fibres. Locating genes for important traits, such as those conferring insect resistance or desired nutrients-is one of the most limiting steps in the process. ## Foods derived from GM crops At present there are several GM crops used as food sources. As of now there are no GM animals approved for use as food, but a GM salmon has been proposed for FDA approval. In instances, the product is directly consumed as food, but in most of the cases, crops that have been genetically modified are sold as commodities, which are further processed into food ingredients. ### Fruits and vegetables Papaya has been developed by genetic engineering which is ring spot virus resistant and thus enhancing the productivity. This was very much in need as in the early 1990s the Hawaii’s papaya industry was facing disaster because of the deadly papaya ring spot virus. Its single-handed savior was a breed engineered to be resistant to the virus. Without it, the state’s papaya industry would have collapsed. Today 80 % of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered, and till n...",
